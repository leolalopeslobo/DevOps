The objective of this course is only for understanding and not practical, because it beyond the scope of the course and beyond the scope of the infrastructure.

# - - -
# DevOps is continous development deployment. Because as a developer if he writes code others should be able to see it and that process should be automated and no one has to manually deploy it on the server

# What is DevOps?
# Docker
# Jenkins
# Microservices
# Kubernetes


### What is DevOps?
# So usually a person was sent to the deployment site to setup the application at the client end (so on-site application)

NodeJS - To create a QR Code
React Native - To develop the mobile

# Cloud is a centralized repository that is avaliable across the globe

# What was DevOps needed?
# Since now we dont have to deploy the application at only one location but we need to at multiple and that cannot be done using the traditionally

# ---
# What is DevOps?
# There will be 2 teams who collaborate in the Project Deployment Cycle.
# Developer team and the Operations team
# The developer team will be responsible for Requirement Gathering, Designing, Deploying Unit Testing, Implementing, Integration and Finally Deployment.
# The stakeholders would be the Product owner, Manager, Team Lead, Senior Programmers, Programmers and QA Team
# The Operations team will be responsible for Automation testing, App Evaluation, Integartions and final deployment.
# User Acceptance Test will be conducted by one user of the Application (Customer) - this person knows everything about the project, understands the process and the application execution. He/She will ensure that the app meets the requirements in an expected manner.
# The stackholders would be Automation Tester, Product Evaluators, UAT Engineers and Customer users who use the product.

### Challenges in this setup
# Many a time, the Operations team are not aware of the technical parts required for the Application. Even if small modifications are required, they fail to work on the same and resolve it.
# Integration of multiple config files across the solution will be huge. Sometimes, it might take days to resolve it
# Applications are expected to be created partially, deployed and continue the development of the Application: Continuous Integration/Deployement (CI/CD)
# The solution for all the above problems is Dev + Ops to go together
# Dev + Ops will work together from the beginning during the Sprint Cycling (Small circles of working environment where people will do the typical software development methodlogies like planning, designing, implementation, testing and deployment all these done into small units) and do collaborative work on resolving deployment issues like versioning of packages that you use in your App development and also helping each other in understanding both the sides of the Project execution.

# ---
# LINTING is the process of performing static analysis on source code to flag patterns that might cause errors or other problems. As an application progresses through the various stages of development, code quality becomes critical.
# ---


# Why DevOps?
# Before DevOps, the Dev and Ops were separate entities and worked in complete isolation. But here, with this mindset, the Testing and Development team were isolated and testing was done always after the complete development is done. This consumed more time than the regular short build cycles, Unexpected challenges used to popup with no clue from the developer team. Manual Code deployment used to have some human errors in the production environment that used to take days to resolve
# With DevOps, S/W delivery is fast and easy. It increases the Deployment easiness. DevOps maintains history which helps in fastening the suture deployment processes a you have a certain experience over your previous deployment of the last Sprint. According to the Inductry analysts, the Deployments done through DevOps have increased the speed of the Total Application Delivery (TAD) by over 20%
# Many of these operations are automated using well tested and popular tools to do your work, Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes are some of the major tools that helpin fastening the activities during the development and deployment

# How Apps are deployed in Real Time
# Git is used to push the code
# Jenkins is used to pull the code and check for tools

# With Agile Development methodology, your Scrum master will plan the sprints. Sprints are short span targets that are realistic and supposed to be met with the scope of development to be a minor one. The duration of the sprint will be ideally 2-3 weeks.
# There will be a sprint planning that includes the division of the task and given a priority, decide on the resources for each task etc.
